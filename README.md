Teleport
========

This plugin allows you to teleport to another player using /tps (player that is teleporting) (target name).
It also notifies the player you teleported to that the person who teleported, teleported to them, as well as lets a player know that they were teleported to the other player! If you have any issues please let me know. This plugin is for 1.7.9!
